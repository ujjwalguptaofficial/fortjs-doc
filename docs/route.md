# Route

In the context of web frameworks a **route** refers to a mapping between a URL pattern and a specific piece of code (usually a controller method) that should be executed when that URL is requested. Routes define how an application responds to different HTTP requests.

In Fort.js, a route consists of two parts:

- **Controller route:** The route associated with the class.
- **HTTP route:** The route associated with the method inside the class.

This distinction helps organize and structure the routing configuration in Fortjs.

## Rest API

Let's understand routing configuration by creating a **Rest API** : A User rest api

### Create controller

The first step is to create a controller and associate it with a controller route. Let's name it - `UserController`

```javascript
import { Controller,} from "fortjs";

export class UserController extends Controller {

}
```

The second step is to associate with it a path and add this to `Fort.routes` array -

```
import { Fort } from "fortjs";
import { UserController } from "@/controllers";

// here we have mapped UserController with path "/user"
Fort.routes = [{
    controller: UserController,
    path: "/user"
}]

await Fort.create();

```

Here we have used path "/user", which means - `UserController` will be executed when path "/user" will be called.


### Create Http Route 

HTTP routes in Fortjs serve as endpoints that are tightly linked with controller methods. When a specific endpoint is invoked, the corresponding method in the associated controller is executed. 

A special decorator `http` is used to -

1. define which **Http Method**` you want to support for your end point. 
2. path of your endpoint

now let's create some endpoints for our rest API.

#### Get

Let's define our first route to fetch all users. Our objective is to trigger the associated controller method when the URL is 'http://localhost:4000/user/all'.

```javascript
import { Controller, http, jsonResult} from "fortjs";

export class UserController extends Controller {

    // highlight-start
    @http.get("/all")
    fetchAllUsers(){
        const allUsers = [];
        return jsonResult(allUsers);
    }
    // highlight-end
}
```

In the code snippet, we've created a **UserController** with a method called **fetchAllUsers**. This method is linked to the path "/all" and HTTP method **GET** using the decorator `@http.get("/all")`. Therefore, it will be triggered when the URL is 'http://localhost:4000/user/all'

:::info

Wondering about the presence of '/user' in the route 'http://localhost:4000/user/all'? It's the controller route we configured in the controller section. This setup offers a neat structure for organizing related routes under the common path '/user'.

:::

**Note:** We won't delve into the details of the logic for fetching the user, as covering the logical part is beyond the scope of this documentation.

---

Now let's create an endpoint that will return the user by ID. Our objective is to trigger the method when the URL is 'http://localhost:4000/user/1', where 1 is the user's ID. This ID can vary, for example, the user ID can be 2, 3, 4, etc.

```javascript
import { Controller, http, jsonResult} from "fortjs";

export class UserController extends Controller {

    @http.get("/all")
    fetchAllUsers(){
        const allUsers = [];
        return jsonResult(allUsers);
    }

    // highlight-start
    @http.get("/{userId}")
    fetchUserById(){
        const userId = this.param.userId;
        const user = {};
        return jsonResult(user);
    }
    // highlight-end
}
```

In the above snippet, we have created a method fetchUserById. This method is linked to the path "/{userId}" and HTTP method GET using the decorator @http.get("/{userId}"). Therefore, it will be triggered when the URL is 'http://localhost:4000/user/1' or 'http://localhost:4000/user/2'.

This covers our GET route customization. Now let's learn about POST route.

#### POST

:::info
The POST HTTP method is used to submit or send data to the specified resource. When a client makes a POST request, the data is included in the body of the request. 
:::

Let's create an endpoint for creating a user. Our objective is to execute the 'createUser' method when the URL is 'http://localhost:4000/user' and the HTTP method is **POST**

```js
import { Controller, http, jsonResult} from "fortjs";

export class UserController extends Controller {

    @http.get("/all")
    fetchAllUsers(){
        const allUsers = [];
        return jsonResult(allUsers);
    }

    @http.get("/{userId}")
    fetchUserById(){
        const userId = this.param.userId;
        const user = {};
        return jsonResult(user);
    }

    // highlight-start
    @http.post("/")
    createUser(){
        const newUserData = this.body;
        return jsonResult(newUserData);
    }
    // highlight-end
}
```

In the above snippet, we have created a method createUser. This method is linked to the path "/" and HTTP method **POST** using the decorator @http.post("/"). Therefore, it will be triggered when the URL is 'http://localhost:4000/user' and HTTP method is **POST**

In addition to the examples mentioned earlier, you can utilize other HTTP methods as follows:

- Patch: `@http.patch`
- Put: `@http.put`
- Delete: `@http.delete`

Feel free to incorporate these methods into your routes as needed.
