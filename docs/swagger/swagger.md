# Swagger

Swagger is an open-source software framework backed by a large ecosystem of tools that helps developers design, build, document, and consume RESTful Web services.

FortJs provides a seperate library - [fortjs-swagger](https://github.com/ujjwalguptaofficial/fortjs-swagger) for swagger integration. It provides automatic generation of swagger documents.
