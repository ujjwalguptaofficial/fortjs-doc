# Swagger Integration with FortJs

Swagger, an open-source framework, supported by an extensive ecosystem of tools, facilitates the design, build, documentation, and consumption of RESTful Web services.

FortJs simplifies Swagger integration with its dedicated library - [fortjs-swagger](https://github.com/ujjwalguptaofficial/fortjs-swagger), enabling automatic generation of Swagger documents.

Explore the following documentation for a comprehensive understanding:
