# Passportjs integration

[Passport](https://github.com/jaredhanson/passport) stands out as the most popular authentication library for Node.js, widely recognized within the community and successfully deployed in numerous production applications. Integrating this library with a FortJs application becomes seamless through the [fortjs-passport](https://github.com/ujjwalguptaofficial/fortjs-passport) module.

Passport boasts a diverse ecosystem of [strategies](http://www.passportjs.org/) that cover a spectrum of authentication mechanisms. Despite the conceptual simplicity, the array of Passport strategies is extensive, offering a wide range of options. Passport streamlines these diverse steps into a standardized pattern.

This guide walks you through the implementation of a comprehensive end-to-end authentication solution tailored for a RESTful API server. The concepts outlined here serve as a foundation for incorporating any Passport strategy, allowing you to customize your authentication scheme. Follow the steps in this guide to construct a fully functional example.

## Requirements

In every web application, it's essential to include the following common logic:

### 1. Registration and Login Routes

#### 1.1 Registration Page
- **Route:** `/register` (GET)
- **Description:** This route renders an HTML page allowing users to register for the application.

#### 1.2 Login Page
- **Route:** `/login` (GET)
- **Description:** Accessing this route will display an HTML page for user login.

### 2. User Login

#### 2.1 Login Post Route
- **Route:** `/login` (POST)
- **Description:** Users can submit their credentials through a POST request to this route for authentication.

### 3. Protected Routes

#### 3.1 Protected Route
- **Route:** `/protected` (GET)
- **Description:** Access to this route is restricted to authenticated users only.

By implementing these routes, users can seamlessly register, log in, and access protected areas within the application.

## Installation

Our first step involves installing the necessary packages. Passport offers a strategy named [passport-local](https://github.com/jaredhanson/passport-local), specifically designed for username/password authentication â€” a fitting choice for this phase of our use case.


```bash
npm i fortjs-passport passport-local
```

You have the option to install typings for passport-local, although it's not mandatory.

```bash
npm i @types/passport-local -D
```

## Implementation

### Initiate

```js title=src/index

import * as path from "path";
import { Fort } from "fortjs";
import { routes } from "@/routes";
import { PassportAuth } from "fortjs-passport";
import { Strategy } from 'passport-local';
import { db } from "./services/db";

export const createApp = async () => {
    Fort.routes = routes;

    //highlight-start
    // Initiate Passport authentication
    PassportAuth.init();

    // Register the local strategy for user login
    PassportAuth.passport.use('local', new Strategy({
        usernameField: 'email',
        passwordField: 'password'
    },
        function (email, password, done) {
            const user = db.users.find(user => user.emailId === email);
            if (!user) { return done(null, false); }
            if (user.password !== password) { return done(null, false); }
            return done(null, user);
        }
    ));
    //highlight-end

    // Create the Fort application
    await Fort.create();

    // Set the application URL
    process.env.APP_URL = `http://localhost:${Fort.port}`;
};

if (process.env.NODE_ENV !== "test") {
    createApp().then(() => {
        Fort.logger.debug(`Your fort is located at address - ${process.env.APP_URL}`);
    }).catch(err => {
        console.error(err);
    });
}
```

In the provided code snippet, the Passport module is initialized using `PassportAuth.init()`, and a local strategy is registered for user login authentication. The configuration includes specifying the username and password fields. The `createApp` function is responsible for setting up the Fort application, and the application URL is logged once the setup is complete.

:::info
1. You can get the `passport` instance by `PassportAuth.passport` and use it for almost everything as you would do in express application.
:::

### Create Controller

Let's Create a controller named `AuthController` which is mapped with route "/auth". This route is accessible to everyone without any authentication.

```js title=src/controllers/auth_controller
import { Controller } from "fortjs"
export class AuthController extends Controller {

}
```

```js title=src/routes
import { AuthController } from "@/controllers/auth_controller";


export const routes = [{
    path: "/auth",
    controller: AuthController
}]
```

### Registration and Login routes

```js
import { http, Controller, viewResult } from "fortjs"
export class AuthController extends Controller {

    // Route for rendering the login page
    @http.get("/login")
    async getLoginPage() {
        const result = viewResult("loginPage");
        return result;
    } 

    // Route for rendering the registration page
    @http.get("/register")
    async getRegisterPage() {
        const result = viewResult("registerPage");
        return result;
    } 
}
```

In the AuthController, two routes, `/login` and `/register`, are defined with the **GET** HTTP method. The `getLoginPage` method renders the login page, and the `getRegisterPage` method renders the registration page using the `viewResult` function.

For information on how `viewResult` works, refer to [viewResult Doc](/docs/concepts/view.md).

### User Login

```js
import { http, Controller, viewResult } from "fortjs"
import { auth } from "fortjs-passport";

export class AuthController extends Controller {

    //highlight-start
    @http.post("/login")
    // apply local guard which will handle the login and pass user in the method
    @guards(auth.guard('local'))
    async doLogin() {
        const { user } = this.request as any;
        return textResult(`Welcome ${user.name}`);
    }
    //highlight-end

    // Route for rendering the login page
    @http.get("/login")
    async getLoginPage() {
        const result = viewResult("loginPage");
        return result;
    } 

    // Route for rendering the registration page
    @http.get("/register")
    async getRegisterPage() {
        const result = viewResult("registerPage");
        return result;
    } 
}
```

In the provided code snippet, a **POST** route for user login has been implemented using the `@http.post` decorator. The `@guards(auth.guard('local'))` decorator is applied to handle the login process using the local strategy. The `user` object is then accessed from the `request`, and a welcome message is returned in the response. 

:::info
The `auth` property from `fortjs-passport` can be utilized to execute the Passport strategy by providing the registered strategy name. It exposes two key functions: `auth.guard` and `auth.shield`. These functions streamline the usage of Passport's authentication features within the Fort.js application.
:::

:::tip
By default, `fortjs-passport` initializes sessions for you to enable persistent authentication. However, you have the option to turn off session support by setting `Fort.shouldParseCookie` to `false`. This action disables cookie parsing, consequently turning off the session functionality.
:::

### Protected route 

Let's create a controller named - `ProtectedController` with route `/protected`. It will have some endpoints and will be accessible to only authenticated user.

```js title=src/controller/protected_controller
import { Controller, shields } from "fortjs";
import { auth } from 'fortjs-passport';

@shields(auth.shield("isAuthenticated"))
export class ProtectedController extends Controller {

}
```

```js title=src/routes
import { AuthController } from "@/controllers/auth_controller";
import { ProtectedController } from "@/controllers/protected_controller";

export const routes = [
    {
        path: "/auth",
        controller: AuthController
    },
    //highlight-start
    {
        path: "/protected",
        controller: ProtectedController
    }
    //highlight-end
]
```

In the provided code snippet, a `ProtectedController` is created with the route `/protected`. The controller is protected by the **isAuthenticated** shield, which is applied using `auth.shield("isAuthenticated")`. This shield ensures that only authenticated users have access to the endpoints within the `ProtectedController`.

#### Access user

Let's create a controller method named - `getUser` which is mapped with route `/user` and http method `GET`. It will return the `user` object as `json`.

```js
import { Controller, shields, http, jsonResult } from "fortjs";
import { auth } from 'fortjs-passport';

@shields(auth.shield("isAuthenticated"))
export class ProtectedController extends Controller {
    
    //highlight-start
    @http.get("/user")
    getUser(){
        // isAuthenticated shield pass `user` via data.
        const { user } = this.data;

        // const user = this.request['user'] - this is how you would get user in expressjs

        return jsonResult(user);
    }
    //highlight-end
}
```
