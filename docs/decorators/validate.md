# validate

Validation in Fort.js is facilitated through the `validate` decorator, enabling you to validate incoming data from HTTP requests. This powerful feature allows validation for:

* HTTP Body
* Query String
* URL Parameters

The `validate` decorator takes a DTO (Data Transfer Object) class as a parameter for validation.
